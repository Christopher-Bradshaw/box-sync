NAME
	sync.py - sync chosen directories with box
	
SETTINGS
	The location of the settings file is specified by the SETTINGS variable in
	sync.py

	The first line in the settings file should specify the folder, in the box
	root directory, where the syncing will be done to. If this folder does not
	exist, it will be created.

	After this, the next lines in the settings files should specify the files/
	directories that are to be synced. 

	Each line should start with the absolute pathname of a file or directory.
	sync should ignore blank lines or missing files/dirs.
	You may specify as many directories as you like.
	
	By default, directories are synced with full recursion (all subdirectories
	are synced too). You can change this behavior with the -r option.

	By default, hidden files and directories are NOT synced. See the -h option.


OPTIONS
	Options are to be specifed on the same line as the directory to which they 
	apply

	-r=X
	Specify the depth of subdirectory that will be synced. 0 will sync only the
	files in the specified directory. 1 will do the files in the specified dir
	and all of its subdirs. etc

	-h
	Sync hidden files and directories

EXAMPLE
	A valid line from the settings file should look as follows (without
	the indent...):
	FILENAME [ -r=X ] [ -h ]

PROBLEMS
	This is by no means perfect. Among the most serious issues are:
	1) No error checking. It should be mostly fine on the client side but if
	   something fails on box's side, sync will fail completely ungracefully...
	2) Does not support multiple devices. If you upload something from another
	   device to the directories used by sync, it will be purged by sync.
	   I can't think of how to do this. Can't see anywhere in box that
	   remembers where the file came from. . .
