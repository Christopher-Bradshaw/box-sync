SETTINGS
	The files/directories to be synced should be specified in the "settings" file.
	This is specified as the SETTINGS variable in sync.py
	
	By default, subdirertories will also be synced. To limit recursion, specify
	-r=x after the directory, where x is the level of subdirectory that will be 
	synced. 0 will just do the files in the specifed directory.

	By default, hidden files will not be synced. Use -h to sync hidden files
